## Demonstration

Want to see in action?

   * You can directly test in your browser with this [demo server](http://peertube.cpy.re). Don't forget to use the latest version of Firefox/Chromium/(Opera?) and check your firewall configuration (for WebRTC)
   * You can find [a video](https://vimeo.com/164881662 "Yes Vimeo, please don't judge me") to see how the "decentralization feature" looks like
   * Experimental demo servers that share videos (they are in the same network): [peertube2](http://peertube2.cpy.re), [peertube3](http://peertube3.cpy.re). Since I do experiments with them, sometimes they might not work correctly.

## Why

We can't build a FOSS video streaming alternatives to YouTube, Dailymotion, Vimeo... with a centralized software. One organization alone cannot have enought money to pay bandwith and video storage of its server.

So we need to have a decentralized network (as [Diaspora](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora) for example).
But it's not enought because one video could become famous and overload the server.
It's the reason why we need to use a P2P protocol to limit the server load.
Thanks to [WebTorrent](https://github.com/feross/webtorrent), we can make P2P (thus bittorrent) inside the web browser right now.

## Installation

### Front compatibility

  * Chromium
  * Firefox (>= 42 for MediaSource support)

### Dependencies

  * **NodeJS >= 4.x**
  * **npm >= 3.x**
  * OpenSSL (cli)
  * MongoDB
  * ffmpeg

#### Debian

  * Install NodeJS 4.x (actual LTS): [https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions)
  * Add jessie backports to your *source.list*: http://backports.debian.org/Instructions/
  * Run:

        # apt-get update
        # apt-get install ffmpeg mongodb openssl
        # npm install -g npm@3

#### Other distribution... (PR welcome)


### Sources

    $ git clone https://github.com/Chocobozzz/PeerTube
    $ cd PeerTube
    $ npm install # Or npm install --unsafe-perm for root user
    $ npm run build

## Usage

### Development

    $ npm run dev

### Test with 3 fresh nodes

    $ npm run clean:server:test
    $ npm run play

Then you will can access to the three nodes at `http://localhost:900{1,2,3}` with the `root` as username and `test{1,2,3}` for the password. If you call "make friends" on `http://localhost:9002`, the pod 2 and 3 will become friends. Then if you call "make friends" on `http://localhost:9001` it will become friend with the pod 2 and 3 (check the configuration files). Then the pod will communicate with each others. If you add a video on the pod 3 you'll can see it on the pod 1 and 2 :)

### Production

If you want to run PeerTube for production (bad idea for now :) ):

    $ cp config/production.yaml.example config/production.yaml

Then edit the `config/production.yaml` file according to your webserver configuration.

Finally, run the server with the `production` `NODE_ENV` variable set.

    $ NODE_ENV=production npm start

**Nginx template** (reverse proxy): https://github.com/Chocobozzz/PeerTube/tree/master/support/nginx

**Systemd template**: https://github.com/Chocobozzz/PeerTube/tree/master/support/systemd

You can check the application (CORS headers, tracker websocket...) by running:

    $ NODE_ENV=production npm run check

### Upgrade

The following commands will upgrade the source (according to your current branch), upgrade node modules and rebuild client application:

    # systemctl stop peertube
    $ npm run upgrade
    # systemctl start peertube

### Other commands

To print all available command run:

    $ npm run help

## Dockerfile

You can test it inside Docker with the [PeerTube-Docker repository](https://github.com/Chocobozzz/PeerTube-Docker). Moreover it can help you to check how to create an environment with the required dependencies for PeerTube on a GNU/Linux distribution.

## Contributing

## Architecture

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](https://github.com/Chocobozzz/PeerTube/blob/master/ARCHITECTURE.md) for a more detailed explication.

### Backend

  * The backend is a REST API
  * Servers communicate with each others through it
    * A network is composed by servers that communicate between them
    * Each server of a network has a list of all other servers of this network
    * When a new installed server wants to join a network, it just has to get the servers list through a server that is already in the network and tell "Hi I'm new in the network, communicate with me and share me your servers list please". Then the server will "make friend" with each server of this list
    * Each server has its own users who query it (search videos, where the torrent URI of this specific video is...)
    * If a user upload a video, the server seeds it and sends the video informations (name, short description, torrent URI...) to each server of the network
    * Each server has a RSA key to encrypt and sign communications with other servers
  * A server is a tracker responsible for all the videos uploaded in it
  * Even if nobody watches a video, it is seeded by the server (throught [WebSeed protocol](http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0019.html)) where the video was uploaded
  * A network can live and evolve by expelling bad pod (with too many downtimes for example)

See the ARCHITECTURE.md for more informations. Do not hesitate to give your opinion :)

### Frontend

There already is a frontend (Angular 2) but the backend is a REST API so anybody can build a frontend (Web application, desktop application...).
The backend uses BitTorrent protocol, so users could use their favorite BitTorrent client to download/play the video with its torrent URI.
